Makerhub is the final project for the Technobel training program. 
It represents the final milestone where participants develop their personal projects, which are then showcased in front of a jury. 

The primary objective of my project is to develop a web application for my company, Hybridvision.
Since i am switching my career path i am building a complete website for my business associate.
The main goal of this site is to centralize and streamline various tasks currently managed by multiple separate applications. 
The site will primarily serve as a showcase for a recording studio, offering features such as buying productions, sample packs, book studio sessions but also more features like creating and sending invoices or quotes on the admin side.#
